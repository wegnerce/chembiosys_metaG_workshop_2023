    "Throughout the course, you will be working with two mock datasets that have been generated _in silico_. Starting from an unknown number of genomes, we have simulated two sequencing runs, and in these two runs the original genomes are differently covered, they differ in their abundance between the two datasets. This will become relevant further down the road, once we start doing assemblies and genome binning.\n",

    "## Recap | DNA sequencing\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into sequence data quality assessment and control, we do a little re-cap regarding DNA sequencing. When we talk about sequencing, we primarily talk about next-generation sequencing (NGS), the term NGS is a bit misleading as we meanwhile use NGS for almost 20 years. Before NGS, [Sanger sequencing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanger_sequencing) was the \"workhorse\" in terms of DNA sequencing. The _de facto_ standard in terms of NGS is Illumina sequencing, there are other NGS platforms, but they only play a minor role or are already obsolote (e.g. 454/pyrosequencing).\n",
    "\n",
    "[This](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2626) meanwhile 10+ years old, but still excellent review by Metzker provides a great introduction into NGS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most NGS techniques/strategies rely on clonally amplified template DNA, this is because the used imaging systems can not resolve single fluorescent events, which are the basis for reading DNA sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Template amplification\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of Illumina sequencing, clonal amplification is achieved via bridge amplification. Template DNA, treated in a way that it carries flanking primers for subsequent amplification, binds to the surface of a flowcell that is covered with complementary probes. Template DNA is amplified by PCR, wobbles over, binds a \"free\" primer and the process is repeated. The resulting clusters make sure that the fluorescent signals generated during sequencing are sufficiently strong for detection.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Sequencing\n",
    "\n",
    "Illumina sequencing relies, as stated above, on cyclic reversible termination. DNA polymerase bound to the template incorporates one fluorescently labelled nucleotide at a time. Unincorporated nucleotides are washed away and imaging is performed to determine the identity of the incorporated base. The fluorescent dye (which blocks and prevents further nucleotide incorporation) is cleaved away and the cycle is repeated.\n",

    "### Sequencing library preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "Library preparation comprises the following stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Shearing\n",
    "2. End-repair and adapter ligation\n",
    "3. PCR enrichment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shearing\n",
    "Remember, we want high-quality DNA for sequencing. For downstream bridge amplification, gDNA has to be sheared, otherwise the resulting clusters blend into each other. DNA shearing can be done by ultrasound or enzymatically. The latter tends to introduce a bias since enzymatic fragmentation is not random.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "❓**QUESTION**\n",
    "\n",
    "How does the length of the template DNA affect clonal amplification and potentially sequencing?!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\t\n",
    "### End-repair and adapter ligation\n",
    "For clonal amplification and sequencing, sheared template DNA must be able to bind to the flowcell. Binding is mediated by adapters/primers that are complementary to primers present on the flowcell. Adapters are added enzymatically by ligation, once the template DNA is end-repaired. End-repaired means the template DNA carries a 3' adenine overhang, which is used to ligate the adapters (see the flowchart below). \n",
    "\n",
    "The adapters look like a hairpin, with a uracil in the middle. This uracil functions as cutting side for the USER enzyme. As a result of this cutting, 5' and 3' ends are now flanked by adapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### PCR enrichment\n",
    "The adapters function as primers for a subsequent PCR that is used to add the sequencing primers (plus barcodes to distinguish samples) to the template DNA. These primers, labelled P5 and P7 in the flowchart, bind the flowcell and are the starting point for CRT-based sequencing.\n",

    "### Quality control of the libraries\n",
    "We quantify the libraries by fluorometry, and assess the size distribution by means of chip-based gelelectrophoresis to save material and because of increased resolution. Chip-based gelelectrophoresis means that we use a microfluidic chip with fine capillaries, which we load with a gel/dye mixture that is pressed into the capillaries. Afterwards samples can be loaded and are separated based on migration through an electric field, just like for \"standard gelelectrophoresis\".\n",
